# CastleGenerator
Generates a castle

Uses a series tables with embedded rules to generate a model lego castle.

The generated castles incorporate elements of existing lego castles that are recolored and combined to form the new castles.

The code is still very messy and over-complicated, with certain exeptions that are hardcoded, and objects that do weird stuff, global variables, object names that are weird, etc
